The DFS Part 504 regulation requires New York State-regulated financial institutions to implement comprehensive programs that monitor for potential violations of BSA/AML regulations and ensure compliance with OFAC sanctions. The rule mandates that these institutions design transaction monitoring and filtering systems based on detailed risk assessments and ensure that they are aligned with changes in laws and regulations. Senior officers must annually certify that these systems are compliant. In addition to internal monitoring, institutions must validate their programs through ongoing testing, documentation, and external audits. This regulation places special emphasis on data quality, requiring institutions to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data used in their monitoring processes. Effective governance, proper documentation, training of personnel, and vendor management are also key elements. Financial Crime and Compliance (FCC) businesses can implement Part 504 by offering comprehensive automated systems that ensure continuous regulatory compliance, regular updates, thorough testing, and proactive risk management for institutions of all sizes.
